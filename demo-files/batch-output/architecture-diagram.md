**Day 1**

1. **Cloud strategy**: Strategy and execution are necessary to avoid disrupting existing key technology systems and business processes. A clear strategy is required to identify the right cloud migration approach and tools. [Azure Migrate | Exploratory Research, Microsoft Cloud Market and Adoption Research part 4].

2. **Migration business case**: Business case evaluation is critical to understanding the impact of migration on business processes and technology systems. Architects must evaluate the cost and benefits of migration and identify the right cloud migration approach. [Azure Migrate | Exploratory Research, Microsoft Cloud Market and Adoption Research part 4].

3. **Relationship analysis**: There is a reluctance of changes to systems and architecture by teams, and architects must identify the relationships between systems and applications to ensure smooth migration. [Azure Migrate | Exploratory Research, Microsoft Cloud Market and Adoption Research part 4].

4. **Exploring migration tools**: Architects must explore migration tools and evaluate their suitability for the migration process. This includes understanding the limitations of tools and identifying the right tools for the migration process. [Azure Migrate | Exploratory Research, Microsoft Cloud Market and Adoption Research part 4].

5. **Vague requirements and complex integration**: It is challenging to gather clear requirements from stakeholders and especially when they don’t know their needs. Navigating the complexities of Microsoft cloud services and selecting the right options when integrating multiple services and aligning with user business requirements leads to the difficulty of defining solutions during migration or designing architecture. [Azure Migrate | Exploratory Research, Microsoft Cloud Market and Adoption Research part 4].

6. **Challenges in cost clarity**: Complexity of licensing models creates challenges in cost calculation, POC preparation, and solution selling especially when trying to build scalability for the customers, and as a result it is why teams are confused, making it difficult to understand cost breakdowns and fluctuations. [Show list user model, POC Virtual Virtual Agent].

7. **Total instruction - time, examples, docs**: Unclear documentation on full functionality and time lead to improper industry understanding of solutions, making it difficult to build effective POCs (Proof of Concept). Additionally, there is a lack of reliable, accurate, and current data, along with insufficient authority specified out-of-the-box solution/instructions. [POC Virtual Virtual Agent, POC Azure CSP Network].

8. **Difficult to choose optimal service**: Struggles to identify accurate solutions and tools due to the existing nature of their work which creates confusion regarding app priorities and different cloud objectives (clearer documentation and unique architecture tools in use in different situations). [Azure Choosing POC | POC Virtual Virtual Agent, Azure CSP Network]. Too limited solutions (more close to Azure POC setup) that require very quick tips on the cloud technologies from cloud architects and plans changing, and low user opportunity to upgrade and lack perspective of wide experience of the cloud service providers. [Azure Migrate | Exploratory Research, Microsoft Cloud Market and Adoption Research part 4].

9. **Compatibility and limitations of solutions**: Understanding app dependencies, compatibility, integration, and lift and shift from on-premise to a different architecture cloud is still a big pain point. Often instances are too ordinary that are exposed by delay or they are offered for add-ons that makes it expensive. Disintegration is incredibly difficult for cloud providers to rely on customer on-prem resources that immediately add extra cost of delay as well as solutions and frames that work across simulations and causing lots of delays when sharing information.

10. **Data transition**: It takes time for key data during migration, they migrate application endpoints and databases from semi-structures to other systems data. [Azure Migrate | Exploratory Research].

11. **Lost work and key implication and frustrations**: Due to many of the many of the issues listed in the above work key, this also happens due to up-to-date or very often rough and when working with 3rd party systems Azure team doesn’t see what people need and during transition there is no good process to track. [POC | POC Evaluation Solutions from CSP, Azure CSP Network].

12. **Time taking to plan, build POC and test**: Building POC takes time, it takes much longer than 20 days of the final period and often doesn’t fit their development cycle. This step is necessary as it is hard to communicate architects in their wide region without planning it. Architects find it time-consuming to do the technical analysis needed for migration planning and it could take up to 10+ weeks as it is an extremely manual process.
