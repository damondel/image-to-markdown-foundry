**Day 1**  
1. **Cloud strategy**: Strategy and execution are necessary to avoid disrupting existing key technology systems and business processes. It is important to identify the right cloud strategy for the organization and align it with business goals. [Azure Migrate | Exploratory Research, ITBD Power Virtual Agents]  

2. **Migration business case**: Business case development is challenging and requires IT architects to identify the right cloud migration strategy and align it with business goals. IT architects need to evaluate the cost and benefits of migration and identify the right cloud platform for the organization. [Azure Migrate | Exploratory Research, ITBD Power Virtual Agents]  

3. **Application portfolio assessment**: Architects need to assess the application portfolio and identify the applications that need to be migrated to the cloud. They need to evaluate the cost and benefits of migration and identify the right cloud platform for the organization. [Azure Migrate | Exploratory Research, ITBD Power Virtual Agents]  

4. **Relationship analysis**: There is a challenge of changes to specific tools and relationships across applications and systems. Architects need to identify the dependencies between applications and systems and evaluate the impact of migration on these dependencies. [Azure Migrate | Exploratory Research, ITBD Power Virtual Agents]  

5. **Operating model**: Architects need to identify the right operating model for the organization and align it with business goals. They need to evaluate the cost and benefits of migration and identify the right cloud platform for the organization. [Azure Migrate | Exploratory Research, ITBD Power Virtual Agents]  

6. **Target requirements and complex integration**: It is challenging to gather clear requirements from stakeholders especially when they don’t know their needs. Navigating the complexities of Microsoft cloud solutions and selecting the right options when integrating multiple services and aligning with user business requirements leads to the difficulty of defining solutions during migration or designing architecture. [Azure Migrate | Exploratory Research, Azure Cost Estimator, ITBD Power Virtual Agents, Microsoft Cloud Market and Audience Research]  

7. **Challenges in cost clarity**: Complexity of licensing models causes challenges in cost calculation, ROI property, and solution selling especially when trying to build scalability for the customers and it is not strictly in terms of usage and cost, making it difficult to understand cost breakdowns and fluctuations. [Azure Migrate | Exploratory Research, ITBD Power Virtual Agents]  

8. **Total instruction - time, examples, docs**: Unclear documentation on full functionality and time lead to improper industry understanding of solutions, making it difficult to build effective Proofs of Concept (POC). Additionally, there is a lack of reliable, accurate, and current data, along with insufficient authority-specific out-of-the-box solution templates. [ITBD Power Virtual Agents, Azure Cost Estimator Research]  

9. **Difficult to choose optimal service**: Struggles to identify accurate solutions and tools due to the existing number of free trial work, cross-conflicting messaging on portals and external channels, cloud services clearer documentation and guidance on which tools to use in different situations. [Azure Cost Estimator, ITBD Power Virtual Agents]  

10. **Importance of deployment plans**: Lack of technical evaluation, and failure to plan and align with business goals leads to delays and increased costs during migration. Architects need to identify the right deployment plan for the organization and align it with business goals. [Azure Migrate | Exploratory Research, ITBD Power Virtual Agents]  

11. **Consider future needs and scalability**: Architects need to consider future needs and scalability when planning migration. They need to evaluate the cost and benefits of migration and identify the right cloud platform for the organization. [Azure Migrate | Exploratory Research, ITBD Power Virtual Agents]  

12. **Clear clarity tasks to avoid delays**: Lack of clarity on tasks and priorities, resulting in delays and increased costs during migration. Architects need to identify the right tasks and priorities for the organization and align them with business goals. [Azure Migrate | Exploratory Research, ITBD Power Virtual Agents]  

13. **Skill and workforce gaps**: Architects need to identify the skill and workforce gaps in the organization and address them during migration. They need to evaluate the cost and benefits of migration and identify the right cloud platform for the organization. [Azure Migrate | Exploratory Research, ITBD Power Virtual Agents]  

14. **Lack of automation and deployment tools**: Lack of automation and deployment tools leads to delays and increased costs during migration. Architects need to identify the right automation and deployment tools for the organization and align them with business goals. [Azure Migrate | Exploratory Research, ITBD Power Virtual Agents]  

**Day 2**  
1. **Troubleshoot and fix**: Help troubleshoot and resolve issues, and offer ongoing support. Architects need to identify the right troubleshooting and support plan for the organization and align it with business goals. [Azure Migrate | Exploratory Research, ITBD Power Virtual Agents]
